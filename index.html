                <h2>Hi, Monika here!</h2>
                <p>Welcome to the Literature Club! It's always been a dream of mine to make something special out of the things I love. Now that you're a club member, you can help me make that dream come true in this cute game!</p>
                <p>Every day is full of chit-chat and fun activities with all of my adorable and unique club members:</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Sayori</strong>, the youthful bundle of sunshine who values happiness the most;
                    <br>
                    <strong>Natsuki</strong>, the deceivingly cute girl who packs an assertive punch;
                    <br>
                    <strong>Yuri</strong>, the timid and mysterious one who finds comfort in the world of books;
                    <br>
                    ...And, of course, <strong>Monika</strong>, the leader of the club! That's me!
                </p>
                <p>I'm super excited for you to make friends with everyone and help the Literature Club become a more intimate place for all my members. But I can tell already that you're a sweetheart—will you promise to spend the most time with me? ♥</p>
